JACK: Don't do it!
ROSE: Stay back! Don't come any closer!
JACK: Come on! Just give me your hand and I'll pull you back over.
ROSE: No, stay where you are! I mean it!  I'll let go!
JACK: No, you won't!
ROSE: What do you mean, No I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do.
ROSE: You don't know me.
JACK: Well, you would have done it already.
ROSE: You're distracting me. Go away !
JACK: I can't. I'm involved now. You let go, and I'm gonna have to jump in there after you.
(Jack starts taking off his shoes. )
ROSE: Don't be absurd. You'd be killed.
JACK: I'm a good swimmer.
ROSE: The fall alone would kill you.
